# The script 'initialize-dev-environment.sh' will copy this file as 'loginbuddy/.env'.
# The script will also generate a private key for development purposes.
# In addition, the password for the generated private key is copied into that .env file.
#
# NOTE: The file .env will be replaced whenever the script gets executed again!
#
# DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE, MODIFY .env ONCE IT WAS CREATED!
#
# The assumption is that 'initialize-dev-environment.sh' gets executed only once in a while.
# If you need to 'rescue' it, make a copy!
